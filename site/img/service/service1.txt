Outdoor Living
Outdoor Living areas include any space outside of the home that effectively acts as additional square footage. These spaces are what we specialize in building, often featuring custom stonework and paving. Outdoor Living areas can be patios, fire pits, wood-burning fire places, grill islands, outdoor kitchen areas, seating areas with wall seats and benches, multi-level terraces, and more.
