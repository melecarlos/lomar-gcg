Fireplaces, firepits & grills
An outdoor fireplace is a great addition to any outdoor living space. It creates a focal point in outdoor spaces. An outdoor fireplace can also extend your enjoyment of outdoor spaces into the fall and winter months, with outdoor grill islands providing a central point of food and fun.
Fire pits also create a natural addition to any patio hardscape, offering a welcoming place for family members and guests to gather to chat, tell stories, and roast marshmallows.
