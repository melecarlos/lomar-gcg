Driveways & entraces
Our custom driveway design and paving boosts curb appeal of homes, seamlessly tying together outside living space elements and the rest of the house. Our paved driveways require little maintenance and can bear more weight than many concrete driveways, never cracking with thanks to the way stones “flex” to accommodate pressure and weight. If settling or displacement occurs in our natural paving stones, the paved driveway can be easily repaired by our experts at LoMar.
